## Information:
This tool helps you to analyze the quality of a website by five different areas. The HTML and CSS source code is validated first. Performance, Accessibility and Technology aspects are also checked. The result is a quality ranking and a list of errors which can be prevented. 

This project is done for a master thesis at the University of applied science in Upper Austria - Hagenberg in 2018.
