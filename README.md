# Project 2 HUE

Team:  Michaela Pfleger & Tamara Czakert

Requirements: 
- Web Application
- React.js + Webpack
- Should use your own node.js server (if necessary)
- Do not directly copy something that already exists - be creative! (I know, thatâ€™s a hard one - especially a second time)
- Should be available offline OR use WebRTC

Idea:
Small game for at least 2 Players. One gets a term which he has to draw on the screen. The other one has to guess which term is drawn. There should be a limitation in time. The guesser gets points if he is right. The drawer gets points too but will get negative points if his drawing is not solved.

Additionally:
It is possible to add two other play modes for mimes and explanations where only the cam or the microphone will be used.
